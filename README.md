# LSTM Demo for Text Generation

Make sure you have anaconda installed. Here are the steps to run the notebook file in your machine.

* Clone the repository
* Create the environment from the environment.yml file : `conda env create -f environment.yml`
* Activate the new created environment
* Update the code in the `To Do` sections in the notebook file and run the notebook again. 
	* Clean dataset to remove unwanted characters before creating the unique mapping dictionary.
	* Change the value of seq_length and prepare the dataset and print their shape.
	* Change the configuration of the model by adding more layers, different LSTM units, dropout rates and optimizer function.
	* Change epoch and batch_size before training the model.
